# Autonomous-car-driving

## Presentation
This project was carried out with the Python language.

### Purpose:
* Research on tasks such as traffic signs recognition, lane-keeping, obstacle detection, within an experimental platform of autonomous car called "Maison de l'Intelligence Artificielle" at Sophia-Antipolis : https://maison-intelligence-artificielle.com
* Integrate Deep Learning algorithms that can be re-used by users who don't know how to program in Python.
* Achieve all the pipeline of a data scientist : data acquisition, data processing, data analysis, create a model, test the model.
* Use of Transfer Learning model (VGG and Inception)
